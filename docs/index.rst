Yet Profound, the Wells of Deep Memory

HOW PATRICK PEARSE TAPPED MEMORIES OF CÃš CHULAINN

==========================================

Project Description
-------

This is my writing sample for graduate school applications. I focus on Irish revolutionary history, particularly the way that Patrick Pearse utilized cultural images and memory to motivate his compatriots and justify his actions against the English in the Easter Rising of 1916.
