The Site Itself
-------------------

This website hosts the paper I wrote for Matt Knight's *Irish Rebels and Revolutionaries* seminar. It's my best work so far, and so I am putting it out onto the internet as an example of my academic work and as an exercise in my developing computer skills. I used GitHub and Atom for the under-the-hood work, Read the Docs for hosting, and Sphinx for formatting (with a little Python 3.6 thrown in). I want to be able to put my own links and webpages down on applications and resumes, and so this is a first step in that direction.


Requests
---------------------

If you would like to know more about the process I used, my notes, or my sources, please feel free to send me an email at josh.whitehurst37@gmail.com or a message on GitHub.

Is this a historical resource?
------------------------------------------

Perhaps you are a student looking for sources for your paper. If so, welcome! This is not the droid you're looking for. You should treat this paper like a wikipedia article; I used real, published resources to write this essay, and so you can utilize my sources to make similar points in your own work. If you do want to just snag my exact words, beware this: since Google knows where to find these words, Google will lead your plagiarism checker or instructor straight to my doorstep. You're much better off accessing the same sources and drawing your own conclusions.

If, however, you think you need to quote me, your instructor needs to know what you're doing and the quality of the sources you're using. If your instructor approves of this paper as a quotable resource, please attribute my work appropriately; depending on your style guide, you may need to take special care to avoid citing me as a published resource (perhaps as an interview or blog post would be best).

Support
---------------------

Since this isn't much of a coding project or tool, you shouldn't have any issues, per se. However, if you find that something is not working correctly, please reach out to me at josh.whitehurst37@gmail.com with any questions, and I may be able to help you resolve your issue.

If you notice issues from an editing perspective or something else you could fix yourself, please utilize GitHub's functionality for collaborative projects (fork the source, push your edits). If you simply take issue with my conclusions, I encourage you to reach out to me or publish your response.
